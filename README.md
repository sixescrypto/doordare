# Do or Dare - Pumpfun Challenge Platform

A dynamic web platform where users can submit dares, vote on them, and administrators can manage which dares become active challenges.

- **Dare Submission**: Users can submit new dares with initial reward amounts
- **Voting System**: 
  - Vote dares up/down for popularity ranking
  - Vote reward amounts up/down ($5 increments per vote)
- **Three Dare Boards**:
  - **Suggested Dares**: User-submitted dares awaiting approval
  - **Active Dares**: Admin-approved dares ready for completion
  - **Completed Dares**: Successfully completed challenges

### üõ† Admin Controls
- **Admin Authentication**: Password-protected admin panel (default: `admin123`)
- **Dare Management**: Move dares between suggested/active/completed states
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark dares as completed and record who completed them
- **Moderation**: Delete inappropriate or duplicate dares

### üíæ Data Persistence
